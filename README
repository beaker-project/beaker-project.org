This is the README for the beaker-project.org  repo, which is used to
create the beaker-project.org web site.

Note that many parts of the web site are built elsewhere:

    * Beaker documentation (under the docs/ and docs-<branch>/ subdirectories) 
      is built using Sphinx from the documentation/ subdirectory of Beaker's 
      source tree (repo: 'beaker').
    * Beaker developer documentation (under the dev/ subdirectory) is built 
      from a separate source repository (repo: 'beaker-dev-docs').

The process for submitting patches is the same as for Beaker itself:

    https://beaker-project.org/dev/guide/writing-a-patch.html#submitting-your-patch

Publishing the live version of the web site on beaker-project.org is handled by 
an internal Jenkins job managed by the Beaker development team.
