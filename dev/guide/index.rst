Developer guide
===============

If you have questions related to Beaker development that aren't
currently answered in this guide, the two main ways to contact the
Beaker development team are currently the same as those for getting
general assistance with using and installing Beaker:

-  the `development mailing
   list <https://lists.fedorahosted.org/mailman/listinfo/beaker-devel>`_
-  the #beaker IRC channel on FreeNode (most active during Australian
   east coast business hours, as that's where most of the current
   developers are based, but you may still find a few folks kicking
   around in European and US time zones)

This document focuses on the mechanics of contributing to Beaker. For
some ideas on possible changes that may be of interest, consult the
:doc:`technical roadmap <../tech-roadmap>`.
